# Data definitions catalogue

Making it easy to discover what data is collected, held or used by government, no matter who defines it, how it is defined, or where it is defined.

## Technology

This service uses Kotlin, Spring Boot and is deployed to Heroku.

For a basic introduction to Kotlin, Spring Boot and Heroku, read the [Getting Started with Kotlin on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-kotlin) article.

## Running Locally

```bash
# Get the source
git clone https://github.com/govau/api-gov-au-definitions.git
cd api-gov-au-definitions/

# Build it
gradle build

# Create a PostgreSQL instance
docker run --name api-gov-au-definitions-db -p 5433:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres:9.6

# Run it
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=notprodordefault \
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/postgres?user=postgres&password=mysecretpassword" \
    java -Xmx200m -Xss512k -jar build/libs/definitions-catalogue-1.0.jar
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5002/definitions/](http://localhost:5002/definitions/).

## Deploying to CloudFoundry

```sh
cf push
```

## Data

This catalogue shows data definitions from the [Standard Business Reporting](http://sbr.gov.au) XBRL taxonomy

You will need to extract the definitions from the XBRL files first, using [this tool](https://github.com/colugo/sbr_taxonomy_usage)

## Documentation

## Reusing government tools

The prototype also uses [Gov.au UI-Kit](https://github.com/govau/uikit). If you want to make any significant changes to the styling, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).
