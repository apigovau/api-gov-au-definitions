# Data definitions catalogue
Making it easy to discover what data is collected, held or used by government, no matter who defines it, how it is defined, or where it is defined.

## Technology
This service uses Kotlin, Spring Boot and is deployed to Heroku.

For a basic introduction to Kotlin, Spring Boot and Heroku, read the [Getting Started with Kotlin on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-kotlin) article.


## Running Locally

Install the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/).

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dxa/definitions-catalogue.git
$ cd definitions-catalogue
$ gradle build
$ heroku local:start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Deploying to Heroku

```sh
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```

## Data

This catalogue shows data definitions from the [Standard Business Reporting](http://sbr.gov.au) XBRL taxonomy

You will need to extract the definitions from the XBRL files first, using [this tool](https://github.com/colugo/sbr_taxonomy_usage)

## Documentation

For more information about using Java and Kotlin on Heroku, see these Dev Center articles:

## Reusing government tools
The prototype also uses [Gov.au UI-Kit](https://github.com/govau/uikit). If you want to make any significant changes to the styling, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).
