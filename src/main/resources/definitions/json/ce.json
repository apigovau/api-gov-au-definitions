Such identifiers are common although they can be highly ambiguous as many places share the same or similar names.\n\nLocations can be described in three principal ways: by using a place name, a geometry or an address. The specific context will determine which method of describing a location is most appropriate.\n\nIn addition to a simple (string) label or name for a Location, this vocabulary defines a property that allows a Location to be defined by a URI, such as a URI used in the Named Authority Lists of the EU Publications Office (NALs) or a GeoNames URI.\n\nThe Core Vocabularies make a minimum number of assumptions about what data will be encoded. A single address may be defined in different ways, a geometry may be defined using different coordinate reference systems and a single place may have no recognised name or multiple names.
