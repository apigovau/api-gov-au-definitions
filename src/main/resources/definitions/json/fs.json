Derivative contracts involve:\n- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or\n- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.\nThe contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).\n\nReport this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity ie where it represents either a net gain or net loss to the entity across all open positions.\n\nNet market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.",

Commonly this is in the form of a loan, usually provided by a related entity. Borrowings are amounts of money on loan from financial institutions or other creditors with the promise or understanding that it will be repaid. \nNet market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.\n\n4) The MTV Adjustment is the value of the Net Policy Liabilities (net of reinsurance) less the Minimum Termination Value (MTV) net of reinsurance excluding the amount of any investment linked risk margin.

Derivative contracts involve:\n- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or\n- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.\nThe contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).\n\nReport this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity ie where it represents either a net gain or net loss to the entity across all open positions.\n\nNet market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.",

Commonly this is in the form of a loan, usually provided by a related entity. Borrowings are amounts of money on loan from financial institutions or other creditors with the promise or understanding that it will be repaid. \nNet market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.\n\n4) The MTV Adjustment is the value of the Net Policy Liabilities (net of reinsurance) less the Minimum Termination Value (MTV) net of reinsurance excluding the amount of any investment linked risk margin. Net Policy Liabilities are valued in accordance with prudential standards LPS 1.04, Valuation of Policy Liabilities, offset by the value of policy liabilities ceded under reinsurance.

The investment linked (IL) risk margin reflects the additional risks that may be borne by the reporting party in conducting investment-linked business.\n\nThe minimum termination value (MTV) is determined by the prudential standards as the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date.

Total Capital Adequacy Requirement is the amount required under the capital adequacy standard to ensure, as far as practicable, that, at any time, the financial position of each business unit of a reporting party is such that the reporting party will be able, out of the assets of the unit, to meet all policy and other liabilities referable to the unit at that time as they become due.

Delta represents the rate of change of an options price for a unit change in the price of the underlying asset.\n\nReport this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity.",

This represents premium revenue determined in accordance with relevant accounting standards, less reinsurance expense determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards.\n\nThis item includes any fire service levy and other levies imposed by state and territory governments and is net of any associated outwards reinsurance expense.\n\nPremium is earned by recognising deferred revenue as a liability in accordance with the pattern of the incidence of risk expected under the policy.\n\nPremium revenue must be recognised in line with the following:\n\nPremium recognition for direct business: Premium revenue must be recognised fully upfront on the date the policy is accepted (bound) by insurers writing direct business. \n\nPremium recognition for inwards reinsurance business: Premium revenue for inwards reinsurance business is to be recognised from the date of acceptance of the reinsurance risk by the reinsurer. Reinsurers are required to recognise the premium based on the Gross Net Premium Income to be written by the direct insurer under the contract for proportional reinsurance. For excess of loss reinsurance contracts, the premium revenue is to be recognised on the basis of the agreed minimum/deposit premium, which will be subject to a final adjustment factor applied to the final declared values of the premium determinant. \n\nPremium revenue must be discounted where it is to be received beyond the current year of cover under an insurance/reinsurance contract. In these cases, use the discount rate as required in calculating insurance liabilities in accordance with GPS 310 Audit and Actuarial Reporting and Valuation. \n\nPremium revenue excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties i.e. government stamp duty and taxes.\n\nPremium refunds and rebates are to be deducted from premium revenue. \n\nFor instalment premium policies, the amount of the annualised premium is to be used. Where premium is calculated on an adjustment basis, the estimated annual premium is to be brought to account, with the estimated premium being replaced by the actual amount as it becomes known. \n\nWhere premium is accepted on a deposit basis, the full annual premium is to be brought into account. \n\nPremium revenue must be gross of reinsurance expense. \n\nPremium revenue includes premium receivable on unclosed business. This includes the business which has been accepted by the insurer/reinsurer prior to the balance date but there is insufficient information to fully identify the business. \n\nReinsurance expense is to be recognised in accordance with the pattern of reinsurance service received as required by relevant Accounting Standards. Reinsurance expense will be recognised from the attachment date over the period of indemnity of the reinsurance contract in accordance with the expected pattern of the incident of risk. This may vary according to the type of reinsurance contract as outlined below.\n\nFor reinsurance written on risks attaching or, equivalently, an underwriting period basis, current reinsurance contracts are fully matched to the underlying insurance portfolios. Reinsurance coverage for the underlying portfolio is recognised as the underlying policies are written.\n\nFor reinsurance written on a losses occurring basis, current reinsurance contracts provide coverage for any risks exposed during the reinsurance period irrespective of when the underlying business was written. Such reinsurance covers both the unexpired portion of policies in force at the contract commencement date and that portion of new business and renewals written during the year that is earned up to the contract expiry date. This latter portion relates to business which has not yet been written at the contract commencement date.\n\nIt is expected that initially the full minimum and deposit premium would be recognised as an expense, with any necessary adjustments due to experience at subsequent relevant dates.\n\nWhere payments under a reinsurance contract extend beyond the current year of cover, reinsurance expense is to be discounted using similar discount rates as required in measuring insurance liabilities in accordance with AASB 1023.",

The risk margin must be assessed at the level specified by APRA for capital purposes; this may not be the same risk margin used for other purposes.\n\n\nAdjusted Accounting NPL is calculated as UPL - DE + DR + URL + TPD where:\n                                                                                                                                        \nUPL = Unearned Premium Liability as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.\n                                                                                                                             \nDE = Deferred Expenses which are any capitalised costs relating to the unearned portion of premium revenue (net of any write-downs resulting from the liability adequacy test), or relating to the deferred portion of existing outwards reinsurance arrangements (for deferred outwards reinsurance expenses), that have been deferred and recognised in accordance with the relevant accounting standards. This includes Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) and Deferred Reinsurance Expense (DRE) as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.  \n                                                                                                                                    \nDR = Deferred Revenue which are any unearned revenues (other than UPL) that represent income used to meet the costs of future claims that will arise under current general insurance contracts that have been deferred in accordance with the relevant accounting standards. This includes deferred reinsurance exchange commission and unearned commission revenue.\n                                                                                                                        \nURL = Unexpired Risk Liability as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.\n\nTPD = Technical Provision Deficiency recognised in premium liability valuations as a result of Liability Adequacy Test determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards.",
